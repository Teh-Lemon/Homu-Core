# Homu-Core
### A collection of static Unity utilities
Any extra instructions will listed in the comments at the top of the file or functions.  
Requires setting Unity to use .net 4.6/C# 6.0.  
These are only tested against whichever Unity version I happen to be using (usually the latest).

I make no promises over the quality or up-to-date-ness of the code.
