# Melon Core
## Collection of Unity utilities

This is the folder I always copy into any new Unity project.

I also include these third party scripts into every new project:
* https://github.com/madsbangh/EasyButtons  
Very quickly add buttons for any function of a script into the inspector window.  
Great for debugging without the need to make an editor script for each script.
* https://github.com/thefuntastic/Unity3d-Finite-State-Machine  
Finite State Machine. Simple and flexible.
* https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/24227  
I use this for my game manager.
